📌 Project Overview
The Hospital Analytics & Forecasting System is a browser-based data analytics application designed to help hospitals and healthcare administrators analyze historical patient visit data and make data-driven decisions. The system processes real-world CSV datasets to generate meaningful insights such as yearly trends, referral analysis, condition severity distribution, and predictive forecasts for future hospital resource requirements.
This project focuses on practical healthcare analytics, combining data processing, visualization, and machine learning into a single, easy-to-use web application.


🎯 Key Objectives
1.Analyze multi-year hospital patient data
2.Identify trends in patient visits, referrals, and condition severity
3.Forecast future patient load using machine learning
4.Support hospital planning for doctors, departments, and equipment
5.Provide insights through an intuitive web interface
